# EPOCH major mode
This is an attempt at creating an Emacs major mode used for editing
EPOCH input decks. EPOCH is a (semi-)open source PIC code for plasma
physics simulations, for whose input files I'm creating an emacs major
mode to help me in my own use of EPOCH.

Please note:   
I am not part of the development team of 
[EPOCH](https://cfsa-pmw.warwick.ac.uk/), I am but a smimple user.

This is a project very much under construction. Let me therefore
apologize in advance for the poor structuring of the code etc. etc.
