# EPOCH major mode
This is an attempt at creating an Emacs major mode used for editing
EPOCH input decks. EPOCH is a (semi-)open source PIC code for plasma
physics simulations, for whose input files I'm creating an Emacs major
mode.

Please note:   
I am not part of the development team of 
[EPOCH](https://cfsa-pmw.warwick.ac.uk/),
I am but a simple user.
